# SpreadsheetTricks
Some simple handy techniques I've developed over the years.

AutoSort: Automatically sorts data in a new column as it is entered with a simpleish formula, no macros or manual sorting.

AutoFilter: Mod based on autosort, automatically filters data according to a predefined condition formula, no macros or manual filtering.

KeyboardHeliFormatter: Creates json file for a simple key + one popup layout compatible with heliboard.
